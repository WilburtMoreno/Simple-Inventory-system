# Simple-Inventory-system
A inventory system that allows you to add, edit, and delete data with MYSQL and simple log in form. This project is ongoing and a lot of problems that need to tackle.
This is my first project to put in open source.
I'm trying to make the create_form.java file to be connected to mainPage.java.
so that when i clicked the create_btn in create_form.java the data that was input from create_form
will append and creates a new row in mainPage's JTable.
the data was saved in localhost but not in jtable.
